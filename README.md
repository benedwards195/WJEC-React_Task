# Development React Task
Using Create React App, a Typescripted React app has been set up which includes an activity component. You are required to complete this component to match the figma prototype given. This includes content, style and functionality.  

The App is already set up, including bootstrap 5.3 and react-bootstrap 2.8 packages. You will only need to modify the files in the **activityComponent folder**. You can use your browsers dev tools to help you debug.
## To begin
Clone this repository into your own workspace. Please organise your work by task, commiting each task with a relevent commit message as you progress.
## Submission
Once you have completed the work. Push your work to your own repository and email a link to **EMAIL** for submission.

## Tasks to be completed

- As a user I expect the hint information from the JSON to be displayed in the footer of the component.  

- As a user I expect the show hint button to **toggle** the showHint state.  

- As a user I expect the content to display in the correct language and to change when the language switch is pressed. 

- Style the hint button to match the figma design. 

- Style the footer element to match the figma design. 

**All console errors and problems need to be resolved before submission.**

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
